              If you won't upload any cover image, the website won't be working 
              No cover photo? Just upload white/black image, thanks.

              Please make sure the images have the same dimensions 
              -- max width or height 1500px.
              (if the image has smaller dimensions, dont change it,
              minimun is 700px in order to see image sharp on the big screen)
              - Then use an online compression tool for example www.tinyjpg.com
              That applies for the cover as well.
              - This helps the website to work smooth and fast on all devices.

              It is definitely better if the images for slider have the same ratio 
              (or combination on one size landscape and portrait format),
              since the slider will adjust the first photo.
