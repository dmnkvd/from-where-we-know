Projectname: Advokacie Práva Kořisti

----

Description:

According to ornithologists, hundreds of birds die every year as a result of pesticide poisoning in the Czech Republic. Even though the use of poisons such as Carbofuran, a toxic pesticide, has been illegal in the EU since 2009, many of these cases have not led to the conviction of the poisoner.  

Advokacie Práva Kořisti (Advocacy of Prey Rights) deals with the unauthorized handling of protected wildlife through the lens of equality in the judicial system, in particular the criminal investigation of the White-Tailed Eagle court case. 

Understanding trans-species communication as a priori condition for solving this issue, the project advocates for recognising non-human rights as a necessary step towards ecological regeneration. Thus, enabling an equal multi-species coexistence so that everyone can experience the environment autonomously.
